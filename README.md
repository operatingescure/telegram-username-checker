REMEMBER: This Tool is not PERFECT. It is practically impossible, to make a fully functional Tool, without breaking the TOS.

Tutorial (its fucking easy...)
1. start the modules.bat
2. start the TG Username Checker.py
3. After the Animation Screen is done loading, a "usernames.txt" will open, enter your desired usernames there (ONE PER LINE!)
4. Thats it, you will get the Resulsts after starting the Check.


THIS TOOL IS COPYRIGHTED, IF YOU STEAL THE SCRIPT OR DO ANYTHING WITH IT, YOU WILL INDEED BE SUED.
